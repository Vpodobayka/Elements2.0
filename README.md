# Elements2.0

This repository is for myself to get hands on with GIT, js and anything else I come across on my journey to learn new things.

I am currently looking for a js montor, my English is not great but I'm more than happy to use GIT with issues and PRs and I'm very happy to communicate by these mechanisims.
